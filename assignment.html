		Striped bass are often called stripers, linesider or rockfish. They are silvery, shading to olive-green on the back and white on the belly, with seven or eight uninterrupted horizontal stripes on each side of the body. They can live in both freshwater and saltwater environments. Spawning begins in the spring and running water is necessary to keep eggs in motion until hatching. Striped bass donâ€™t have eyelids so when the sun comes up, they will retreat to deeper water to avoid the bright light. A female striped bass can lay up to 3,000,000 eggs and the female will grow larger than the males.
